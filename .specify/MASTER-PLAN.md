| **Performance not meeting SLAs** | High | Low | Regular performance testing, optimize as needed | Dev Team |
| **Security vulnerabilities in encryption** | Critical | Low | Security audit, use proven libraries (Sorcha.Cryptography) | Security |

### Medium Priority Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| **SignalR scaling challenges** | Medium | Medium | Use Redis backplane, load testing | DevOps |
| **Test coverage insufficient** | Medium | Low | TDD approach, coverage enforcement | QA |
| **Documentation incomplete** | Medium | Medium | Document as we build, review gates | Tech Writer |

### Low Priority Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| **P2P service delays** | Low | Low | Not critical for MVD, defer if needed | Architecture |
