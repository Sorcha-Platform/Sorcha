## Security Hardening (P0-P1)

| ID | Task | Priority | Effort | Status | Assignee |
|----|------|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| SEC-001 | HTTPS enforcement and certificate management | P0 | 4h | ✅ Complete | 2026-01-29 |
| SEC-002 | API rate limiting and throttling | P1 | 8h | ✅ Complete | 2026-01-30 |
| SEC-003 | Input validation hardening (OWASP compliance) | P1 | 12h | ✅ Complete | 2026-01-30 |
| SEC-004 | Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options) | P1 | 4h | ✅ Complete | 2025-12-09 |
| SEC-006 | Enforce wallet-to-user binding in Blueprint Service | P1 | 12h | ✅ Complete | 2026-02-10 |

**Related:** BP-8.2 Security hardening task (promoted from P1 in Phase 1)

### SEC-005: Blueprint Service Security Hardening (BP-11.2)

✅ **Complete (2026-02-07)** — Endpoint audit and hardening
- ✅ ActionsHub SignalR hub secured with `[Authorize]` + `.RequireAuthorization()`
- ✅ File download endpoint (`/api/files/...`) secured with `CanExecuteBlueprints` policy
- ✅ CORS policy added (matching API Gateway and Tenant Service patterns)
- ✅ Health endpoint marked `.AllowAnonymous()` for explicit intent
- ✅ 13 generic catch blocks hardened — no longer leak `ex.Message` to clients
- ✅ All exception paths now log via `logger.LogWarning()`

### SEC-006: Enforce Wallet-to-User Binding in Blueprint Service

✅ **Complete (2026-02-10)** — Security enforcement for wallet ownership

**Problem:** The Blueprint Service validated JWT roles but did **not** verify that the `senderWallet` in an action submission belongs to the authenticated user.

**Solution:** Added `ValidateWalletOwnershipAsync` in `ActionExecutionService` that validates wallet ownership via `IParticipantServiceClient` before any signing occurs.

**Requirements:**
- [x] On action execution (`POST /api/instances/{id}/actions/{actionId}/execute`), validate that `senderWallet` is linked to the authenticated user via Participant Identity Registry
- [x] Cross-reference `IParticipantServiceClient.GetLinkedWalletsAsync()` to confirm the user owns the wallet
- [x] Return 403 Forbidden if wallet does not belong to the authenticated user
- [x] Add bypass for service principal tokens (service-to-service calls) and null caller (backward compat)
- [x] Add unit tests for wallet ownership validation (8 new tests)
- [x] Also enforced on reject endpoint (`POST /api/instances/{id}/actions/{actionId}/reject`)

**Related:** AUTH-001, SEC-005, Participant Identity API

## First-Run Setup & Commissioning (P0 - BLOCKER)

| ID | Task | Priority | Effort | Status | Assignee |
|----|------|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| SETUP-001 | First-run setup wizard/script for fresh installations | P0 | 24h | ✅ Complete | 2026-01-31 |

### SETUP-001 Problem Statement

**Issue:** On a totally clean build or fresh Docker Desktop installation, numerous key service resources are missing, causing startup failures:

- Docker volumes for key storage (wallets, certificates)
- File caches and data directories
- `.env` files with deployment-specific configuration
- Database initialization (schemas, seed data)
- Redis configuration and initial state

**Impact:** New developers or fresh deployments cannot start the system without manual intervention and tribal knowledge.

### SETUP-001 Requirements

The solution must provide an interactive setup process that:

1. **Environment Detection:**
   - Detect if this is a first-run (missing volumes, .env, databases)
   - Check Docker Desktop availability and version
   - Verify required ports are available (80, 5432, 6379, 27017, etc.)

2. **Configuration Generation:**
   - Prompt for deployment-specific values (organization name, admin email, domains)
   - Generate `.env` file with secure defaults
   - Generate `appsettings.Local.json` overrides
   - Create service-specific configuration files

3. **Infrastructure Provisioning:**
   - Create required Docker volumes (`sorcha-postgres-data`, `sorcha-redis-data`, `sorcha-mongo-data`, `sorcha-wallet-keys`)
   - Create required directories (`./data/caches`, `./data/logs`, `./data/uploads`)
   - Set appropriate permissions

4. **Database Initialization:**
   - Run database migrations for all services
   - Seed initial data (organizations, admin user, service principals)
   - Verify database connectivity

5. **Validation:**
   - Health check all infrastructure services
   - Verify service-to-service connectivity
   - Generate setup report with credentials and next steps

### SETUP-001 Deliverables

**Wallet Encryption (2026-01-20):**
- [x] `scripts/fix-wallet-encryption-permissions.ps1` - Quick fix for volume permissions (Windows)
- [x] `scripts/fix-wallet-encryption-permissions.sh` - Quick fix for volume permissions (Linux/macOS)
- [x] Updated `LinuxSecretServiceEncryptionProvider` with `EnsureFallbackDirectoryIsWritable()` validation
- [x] Updated `setup-wallet-encryption-docker.ps1/.sh` to fix permissions during setup
- [x] Added helpful comments in `docker-compose.yml` about permissions requirement

**Remaining Deliverables (2026-01-31):**
- [x] `scripts/setup.ps1` - PowerShell setup wizard (Windows)
- [x] `scripts/setup.sh` - Bash setup script (Linux/macOS)
- [x] `scripts/setup-config.yaml` - Configuration template with defaults
- [x] `scripts/validate-environment.ps1` - Environment validation script
- [x] `docs/FIRST-RUN-SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide
- [ ] Update `docker-compose.yml` to fail gracefully with helpful messages if not commissioned (deferred)
- [ ] Add pre-flight check to AppHost that detects missing resources (deferred)

### SETUP-001 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Fresh clone + `docker-compose up` shows clear message to run setup first (deferred)
- [x] Setup script runs interactively with sensible defaults
- [x] Setup script can run non-interactively with config file for CI/CD (`-NonInteractive` flag)
- [x] All services start successfully after setup completes
- [x] Setup can be re-run safely (idempotent - detects existing installation)
- [x] Clear documentation for both developers and operators (`docs/FIRST-RUN-SETUP.md`)

## Launch & Discoverability (P2 — v1 go-live)

| ID | Task | Priority | Effort | Status | Assignee |
|----|------|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| DISC-001 | **Publish MCP server to registries** | P2 | 6h | 📋 Parked (v1 go-live) | - |
| DISC-002 | schema.org / JSON-LD on the docs site (`SoftwareApplication` + `FAQPage`) | P2 | 4h | 📋 Not Started | - |

### DISC-001 — Publish MCP server to registries (parked for v1 go-live)

The serving foundation is **done + live on n1**: `/llms.txt`, `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, served
OpenAPI + `/.well-known/mcp.json` (with correct F136 issuer/audience), GitHub topics. What remains is
**publishing** the 36-tool MCP server so other AI agents discover + install it — the highest-leverage
promotion step. Deferred to the v1 go-live list (not pre-release-blocking).

- `server.json` (repo root) is **drafted**; runbook at `docs/mcp-registry-publishing.md`.
- Steps: verify the `io.github.sorcha-platform` namespace (GitHub OIDC), pin a real `version`, add a
  release-triggered `mcp-publisher publish` workflow gated on `docker-publish`, then submit to
  Smithery / Glama / PulseMCP / mcp.so and the `awesome-*` lists (mcp-servers, self-sovereign-identity,
  verifiable-credentials).
- Pre-req met: `sorchadev/mcp-server:latest` is published to Docker Hub.
